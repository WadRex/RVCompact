# RVCompact
Fully Portable RVC: Voice Cloning Software

# Description
This project is a portable adaptation of [RVC](https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI), a software that enables you to create a realistic voice clone. My primary goal is to simplify the software's installation process. This project offers a fully portable solution for installing and using RVC, ensuring its accessibility and convenience from any location.

The project aligns with the version of [RVC](https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI) at commit [937d748c672abbc49ea0f7f727f2760fc487f4ed](https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI/commit/937d748c672abbc49ea0f7f727f2760fc487f4ed). Any significant feature updates or crucial bug fixes in the original repository will prompt an update to this project as well.

# Installing
